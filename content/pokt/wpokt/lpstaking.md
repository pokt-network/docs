### How does providing liquidity for wPOKT work?

Providing liquidity for wPOKT will be done through Uniswap v2, an automated market maker on Ethereum. In taking a liquidity provider (LP) position in Uniswap v2, you are providing both wPOKT and ETH in equal portions of USD value and putting them into a constantly rebalancing 50/50 basket, rebalancing in line with market price movements. For wPOKT, Uniswap v2 was chosen over the more recently deployed Uniswap v3, as v3 requires a much more active process of dynamically adjusting price ranges to provide liquidity, limiting community participation as LPs. Uniswap Liquidity providers help improve the liquidity of wPOKT while allowing LPs to earn Uniswap trading fees and POKT liquidity incentives provided by the DAO. You can learn more about how Uniswap works here - [Uniswap 101](https://blog.uniswap.org/what-is-uniswap).

### How can I get wPOKT-ETH LP tokens?

In Uniswap, LPs are provided with LP tokens which represent ownership of part of the assets in the pool. This token acts as a receipt which can be returned to collect the LPs share of the assets as well as trading fees earned by the pool. Every LP in the wPOKT/ETH pool will receive a wPOKT-ETH LP token which will act as proof of ownership of their rights to the underlying wPOKT/ETH (and additional profits) in the liquidity pool.

### What is the benefit of staking LP tokens?

LPs can stake their LP tokens by going to the stake tab in the wPOKT Liquidity Pool Farm app - see **[here](https://wpokt-staking-frontend.vercel.app/)** for a demoÂ  - connecting their Ethereum wallet, specifying how much of their LP position they want to stake and then staking their LP tokens. LPs who stake their LP tokens will earn wPOKT liquidity incentives over time for providing liquidity to the wPOKT-ETH pool proportional to their share of the pool.

### How much can I earn as an LP for wPOKT?

The return from being a LP for the wPOKT-ETH pool will depend on the price of POKT and ETH over time, the volume and trading fees earned by the pool over time and the value of the wPOKT liquidity incentives. LPs may suffer losses in value if one or both of the assets in the pool fall in value. To see more about the risks of LPing, see here - [Uniswap 101](https://blog.uniswap.org/what-is-uniswap).

### How can I claim my wPOKT LP rewards?

You can see your wPOKT LP rewards accruing on the wPOKT-ETH Liquidity Pool Farm page, and they can be claimed every block by hitting claim wPOKT under wPOKT Rewards.

### How can I unstake my LP tokens?

You can unstake your LP tokens by going to the withdrawal tab on the wPOKT-ETH Liquidity Pool Farm page, connecting your Ethereum Wallet, and specifying how much of your LP position you would like to unstake. You then need to remove your liquidity from the Uniswap pool to receive back your proportionate share of the wPOKT and ETH in the pool.
