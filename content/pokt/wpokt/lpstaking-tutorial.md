### wPOKT / ETH Liquidity Pools on Uniswap
The wPOKT/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap is now open.

LP incentives are live at 10am EST on Thursday October 12th.

There will be an advantage to being in early, so it's best to get set up ahead of time.

If you want to participate, here's your step-by-step guide.

First stop: Uniswap https://app.uniswap.org.

Make sure you're connected with MetaMask.

Next, click on 'Pools' and gear up for some LP action.

We're playing on v2, folks.

Click 'More' and select 'v2 Liquidity'.

ETH should be there.

Now, select wPOKT to pair them up.

Can't see it?

Enter the contract address:

Now, input how much ETH and wPOKT you want to add to the pool.

Then hit 'Approve'.

You'll need to set a spending cap for your wPOKT.

Uniswap suggests one, but feel free to adjust.

![5](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/docs/assets/6369871/991dfdb6-833e-4e8c-ab41-feb098b25490)

Once adjusted, hit 'Supply' & 'Confirm'.

And just like that, you're an ETH/wPOKT LP!
