description: How to add the Gnosis Chain in MetaMask with a Pocket-powered RPC Endpoint
---


{{< youtube  >}}
We have minted a public Gnosis RPC endpoint to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for xDAI, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **Gnosis Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://gnosischain-rpc.gateway.pokt.network/`
4. Put the hexadecimal **0x64** in the ChainID field
5. Write **XDAI** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai` as the Block Explorer URL
7. Don’t forget to save
