# 🗳 Claim Your Vote

The DAO onboarding process has been designed to assign governance powers to the most engaged, knowledgeable, and experienced members of the Pocket Network community.

The steps for obtaining a vote are as follows...

## 1. Get Qualified

First, you need to prove your knowledge of and participation in the Pocket Network by earning trophies.

There are four paths that you can take on this journey:

{% page-ref page="app-developer-path.md" %}

{% page-ref page="node-runner-path.md" %}

{% page-ref page="community-shepherd-path.md" %}

{% page-ref page="governor-path.md" %}

You will complete a series of quests and report your completion of these quests in the [🏆trophies](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/763504639299289138) channel in Discord. Follow the path guides above to see which quests are up next and how many you need to evolve.

Once you have evolved to the 3rd level of any path, you have qualified for a vote in the DAO. Type `!qualify` in the [🏆trophies](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/763504639299289138) channel.

## 2. Get Verified

You also need to prove that you are a unique human being by verifying with BrightID.
