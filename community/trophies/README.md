# 🗳 Trophies

*Claim Your Vote!*

The DAO onboarding process has been designed to assign governance powers to the most engaged, knowledgeable, and experienced members of the Pocket Network community.

The steps for obtaining a vote are as follows...

## 1. Get Qualified

First, you need to prove your knowledge of and participation in the Pocket Network by earning trophies.

There are four paths that you can take on this journey:

* [**App Developers**](app-developers.md)
* [**Node Runners**](node-runners.md)
* [**Community Shepherds**](community-shepherds.md)
* [**Governor/Contributors**](contributors.md)


You will complete a series of quests and report your completion of these quests in the [🏆trophies](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/763504639299289138) channel in Discord. Follow the path guides above to see which quests are up next and how many you need to evolve.

Once you have evolved to the 3rd level of any path, you have qualified for a vote in the DAO. Type `!qualify` in the [🏆trophies](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/763504639299289138) channel to obtain the Qualified role.

## 2. Get Verified

If you want to be verified by our existing Voters, and obtain the Verified role, you must do both of the following:

1. Post a selfie to the #✅verify channel holding a piece of paper with your Discord username (e.g. username#1234) and the day's date
2. Post a message to the #✅verify channel with the following template:

> !verify
>
> My favorite thing about Pocket Network:
>
> Why I want to be a Voter:
>

Once you have done this, if existing Voters are comfortable you are not a malicious agent, they will approve you. If 33% of existing Voters approve you in the next 7 days, you'll be officially verified and one step closer to obtaining your own vote in our DAO.

## 3. Claim Your Vote

Type `!claim-vote` in the [🏆trophies](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/763504639299289138) channel. This will only work if you got both the Qualified and Verified roles.

Then DM jackal to claim your POKTDAO token airdrop (our airdrop bot is currently out of commission).

{% hint style="info" %}
The token is non-transferable so you should choose a MetaMask or WalletConnect wallet that you're happy holding the token in forever.
{% endhint %}

## 4. Vote and Subscribe

1. Vote in our [governance dashboard](https://gov.pokt.network) by connecting the wallet you chose for your POKTDAO airdrop.
