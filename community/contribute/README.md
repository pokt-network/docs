## How to Contribute

### Submit an RFP – Highlight a Need

An RFP is a Request for Proposal. You would use this when you know that something is needed but you are unsure of exactly what the solution is or are unable to build it yourself. Posting an RFP should serve as a signal to other community members that there might be demand for their contributions.

For example, this [Node Deployment Solutions RFP](https://forum.pokt.network/t/rfp-7-node-deployment-tools/819) which led to the successful PEP \(POKT grant\) for an automated deployment tool called Node Pilot.

To submit an RFP, head to the [RFP forum category](https://forum.pokt.network/c/needs/proposal-requests/40) and click New Topic.

### Submit a PEP – Earn a POKT Grant for Your Work

A PEP is a type of proposal that requests a POKT grant from the DAO treasury. You could get a POKT grant for contributions to the Pocket Network ecosystem.

Read more about [submitting a proposal](../governance/proposals.md).

### Submit a PR - Become an Active Pocket v1 Contributor

You can become an open-source contributor by submitting contributions to the [Pocket protocol specifications](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-network-protocol) or the [main v1 Pocket implementation](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket).

All the issues are documented and tagged on [Github](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues), and the ["starter task" tag](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22starter+task%22) can be used to filter for simpler issues to get you acquainted with the codebase.

All of these contributions are under the MIT license but may be partially rewarded by the [scholarship fund](community/contribute/scholarships.md). Larger contributions from repeat contributors will be evaluated by the DAO through separate proposals.

In addition to contributing to the future of Web3, you will also get mentorship and experience by working with the core Pocket team, as well as present and discuss your work in our weekly contributor hours.
