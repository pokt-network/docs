# 👋 Welcome

Pocket Network is the TCP/IP of Web3 node infrastructure – a multi-chain relay protocol that incentivizes RPC nodes to provide DApps and their users with unstoppable Web3 access.

Pocket supports [dozens of blockchains](supported-blockchains.md), with more being added all the time.

## Get Started

### Use Pocket Network's RPC

Using Pocket Network is as easy as any other RPC. If you're already using a centralized RPC provider, the [Pocket Portal](https://portal.pokt.network) was built to allow a seamless transition with URLs you can claim below. Alternatively, you can integrate directly with [PocketJS](https://docs.pokt.network/js/).

* [Get a public RPC URL for your wallet](use/public-rpc/README.md)
* [Create a private RPC URL for your DApp](use/get-endpoint.md)

### Run a POKT Node

* [Learn the basics of staking POKT](pokt/stake.md)
* [Learn how to run your own node](node/README.md)

### Shape Pocket Network's Future

* [Learn how to contribute to the Pocket Network ecosystem](community/contribute.md)
* [Learn how to become a member of the DAO](community/trophies/README.md)
