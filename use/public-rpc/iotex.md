# IoTeX

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/XXzlplnOR7M" %}

We have minted a public IoTeX RPC endpoint with up to 1M requests per day to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for IoTeX, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **IoTeX Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://iotex-mainnet.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/6176f902e19001003499f492`
4. Put the decimal **4689** in the ChainID field
5. Write **IOTX** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://iotexscan.io` as the Block Explorer URL
7. Don’t forget to save
