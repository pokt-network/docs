# Polygon

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/C0jDq20pBYQ" %}

We have created a public Polygon RPC endpoint with up to 5M requests per day to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

More details here:

[https://forum.matic.network/t/pocket-network-creates-free-polygon-rpc-community-endpoints/1597](https://forum.matic.network/t/pocket-network-creates-free-polygon-rpc-community-endpoints/1597)

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for Polygon, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC 
2. Under the Network Name field, write **Polygon Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://poly-rpc.gateway.pokt.network/`
4. Put the decimal **137** in the ChainID field
5. Write **MATIC** as the Symbol
6. Add [https://polygonscan.com](https://polygonscan.com) as the Block Explorer URL
7. Don’t forget to save
