# Ethereum \(ETH\)

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/8ruuz3u2V2E" %}

We have created a public Ethereum RPC endpoint with up to 10M requests per day to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for Ethereum mainnet, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **Ethereum Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://eth-rpc.gateway.pokt.network`
4. Put the decimal **1** in the ChainID field
5. Write **ETH** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://etherscan.io` as the Block Explorer URL
7. Don’t forget to save
