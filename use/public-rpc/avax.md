  Endpoint

# Avalanche \(AVAX\)

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/9SNGe2tfmmw" %}

We have created a public Avalanche RPC endpoint with up to 1M requests per day to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for Avalanche C-Chain, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **Avalanche Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://avax-mainnet.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/605238bf6b986eea7cf36d5e/ext/bc/C/rpc`
4. Put the hexadecimal **0xa86a** or decimal **43114** in the ChainID field
5. Write **AVAX** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/` as the Block Explorer URL
7. Don’t forget to save
