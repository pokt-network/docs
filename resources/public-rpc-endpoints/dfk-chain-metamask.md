# DFK Chain MetaMask

We have created a public DFK Chain RPC endpoint that give players who play DeFi Kingdoms the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for DFK Chain subnet, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **DFK Chain POKT**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://avax-dfk.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/6244818c00b9f0003ad1b619//ext/bc/q2aTwKuyzgs8pynF7UXBZCU7DejbZbZ6EUyHr3JQzYgwNPUPi/rpc`
4. Put the decimal **53935** in the ChainID field
5. Write **JEWEL** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://explorer.dfkchain.com/` as the Block Explorer URL
