# Conquest.eth

We have minted a public Görli RPC endpoint with up to 10M requests per day to give players who are exploring the [Conquest](https://conquest.eth.limo) metaverse the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, resilient infra!

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for Görli testnet, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **Görli Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://eth-goerli.gateway.pokt.network/v1/lb/619f72f64df71a00392de6d9`
4. Put the decimal **5** in the ChainID field
5. Don’t forget to save
